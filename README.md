# QFL with Deep-Unfolding Network
This repository comprises all the works related to the quantum federated aggregation strategy, applying novel strategies to enhance the aggregated model performance.
--Methods--
01. We evaluate the VQC with different settings and federated aggregation.
-  Setting: 
    I). Change the optimizers in between COBYLA, SPSA,
    SLSQP, CMA-ES.
    II). Change the Circuit structure as TwoLocal, RealAmplitude, and EfficientSU2.
    III). Change the feature maps as zfeaturemap, zzfeaturemap, and paulifeaturemap.
